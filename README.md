Email about parentheses in data

TODO:
 * Buy/Sell(only checking the clients account if enough shares/funds left)
 * Profit/Loss
 * Alerts
 * Report Generation
 * Transaction/Order
 * Deposit/Withdrawal <-- Additional feature, work on after Peer Acceptance
 * Unit Tests?
 * Once a login account has been successfully created, either a client or an HKeInvest employee should
 -be able to change any of the account and client information except for account type, date of birth and
 -HKID, which should never be changed. A clientâ€™s name, country of citizenship, country of legal
 -residence passport number and passport country of issue should be able to be changed by an
 -HKeInvest employee, but only if the client has made a request in writing with supporting
 -documentation. A securities account number and a user name should never be changed.
 +Add auto postback to account application page
 +Register client validation for two letters of last name (This was previously removed)
  
 -Random things to do:
 * Add auto postback to account application page
 * Register client validation for two letters of last name (This was previously removed)
 * Add the required testing data before Tuesday's lab so we don't get disqualified
 * Move Buy/Sell to Client_Only folder so only clients can access it
 * Linking pages together so they can actually be accessible
 * Email about parentheses in data
