# COMP3111 Team USA (106)

TODO:
* Securities Searching(kevin)
* Buy/Sell(only checking the clients account if enough shares/funds left)
* Profit/Loss
* Alerts
* Currency Conversion(I think this was done in the previous labs, can anybody confirm it's not need anywhere else?)
* Report Generation
* Transaction/Order
* Deposit/Withdrawl <-- Additional feature, work on after Peer Acceptance
* Unit Tests?
* Once a login account has been successfully created, either a client or an HKeInvest employee should
be able to change any of the account and client information except for account type, date of birth and
HKID, which should never be changed. A clientâ€™s name, country of citizenship, country of legal
residence passport number and passport country of issue should be able to be changed by an
HKeInvest employee, but only if the client has made a request in writing with supporting
documentation. A securities account number and a user name should never be changed. 



Random things to do:
* Move Buy/Sell to Client_Only folder so only clients can access it
